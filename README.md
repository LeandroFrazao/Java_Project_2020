Module Learning Outcomes Assessed
• Select and integrate multiple algorithms and constructs to solve a larger problem in a real-world context while identifying and appraising the trade-offs of different candidate approaches in terms of space and time complexity.
• Develop and implement custom algorithms and constructs for a wide variety of application-specific tasks, taking performance and system resources into consideration.
• Employ a variety of different constructs and to implement and categorise different searching and traversal algorithms over said constructs
Assignment Introduction
A library has come to you as a developer and outlined that currently they do not have any software to track the different titles they have in stock, users of the library and borrowings. They have asked you to develop a system which will allow them to do this. The library doesn’t have a budget for a database, so your solution must implement a text file based system to ensure persistency of the data.
Specific Requirements
• The library system must include the following entities:
o Book: To model all data relevant to the books. ID, title, author and/or any other piece of information that you consider relevant.
o Reader: To model all data relevant to the users of the library. ID, name, address and/or any other piece of information that you consider relevant.
• When the program is executed, it must automatically load onto memory the data that exists on the text files(s) in the form of objects. Books, readers and any other entity that you include in your design (e.g. borrowings).

• Consider your user to be an employee from the library. After all the data has been loaded, the user should be presented with the following options.
o Search for a specific book by title and/or author name.
o List all books by title and/or author name alphabetical order.
o Search for a specific reader by name and/or ID.
o List all users by alphabetical and/or ID order.
o Register that a reader has borrowed a book.
o Register that a reader has returned a book.
o For a specific reader, list the books that they have borrowed.
• In order to perform these tasks, you should implement APPROPRIATE constructs, data structures as well as searching and/or sorting algorithms.
• This is a command line program, and the use of graphic user interfaces is not allowed (i.e. JavaSwing, JavaFX, GUI builders, etc.).
Notes
• Try to keep it simple. Plan your program before start coding.
• Comment your code!!
• Plagiarism will not be tolerated. All code must be your own. If you used some snippet of code from an external source, make sure that you reference it correctly inside your code.
• In any situation, the lecturer is entitled to call you in for further explanation of your code.
• Your code must run as no debugging will be done.
Deliverables
• You must submit your full Eclipse/NetBeans project with all source code and data text files in a zip named after your student number. This compressed folder should be submitted to Moodle.
• One page document PDF document including
o Explanation of the structure of your code.
o Short justification for your logic design decisions.
o Explanation of the structure of the text files used to ensure data persistency.
